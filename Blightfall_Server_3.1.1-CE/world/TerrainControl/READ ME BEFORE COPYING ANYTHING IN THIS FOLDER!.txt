These config files have been altered since the world was generated. Attempting to create a new world with these configs will not work properly.

The original configs were altered versions of configs written by Stephan "MySource", a former developer of Terrain Control. At his request, we have chosen to cease redistributing configs that were capable of generating the terrain you see in Blightfall.

If you are a server owner, and need the original configs for any reason, please contact Stephan at swia@gmx.de. With his permission, the Technic Team will happily send you the configs necessary to regenerate the world.

Failing that, the remaining information in these configs are enough to play Blightfall using the pre-shipped map with no problems.
