    DialogText: "Well, most people don't bother toask. Here are a few tips:Hunger's going to be a problem.Try not to run or jump. Build stairsto conserve energy if you minedeep. The purple biomass will hurtyou if you step on it, but not killyou if you stay well fed. Make sureto go on scouting expeditions toimpress the leadership. You canuse that goodwill to requisition foodlater if you get in a tight spot.Seriously; we expect you to ask forfood. There's no shame in it.Speaking of that, don't forget toask Driskel for seeds wheneverpossible. You need to keep yourdiet varied; two stacks of bread does not a healthy diet make.Driskel's seeds will help with that.",
